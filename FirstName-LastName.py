Revature is building a new API! This API contains functions for validating data, 
solving problems, and encoding data. 

The API consists of 10 functions that you must implement.

Guidelines:
1) Edit the file to match your first name and last name with the format shown.

2) Provide tests in the main method for all functions, We should be able to run
this script and see the outputs in an organized manner.

3) You can leverage the operating system if needed, however, do not use any non
legacy command that solves the problem by just calling the command.

4) We believe in self commenting code, however, provide comments to your solutions
and be organized.

5) Leverage resources online if needed, but remember, be able to back your solutions
up since you can be asked.

6) Plagiarism is a serious issue, avoid it at all costs.

7) Don't import external libraries which are not python native

8) Don't change the parameters or returns, follow the directions.

9) Assignment is optional, but totally recommend to achieve before Monday for practice.

Happy Scripting!

Use the main function for testing purposes and to show me results for all functions.

1. Reverse a String. Example: reverse("example"); -> "elpmaxe"
def reverse(string):
     str=""
     for ch in string:
             str= ch+str
     return str
2. 
Convert a phrase to its acronym. Techies love their TLA (Three Letter
Acronyms)! Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a
long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

return: str
